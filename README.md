# Final Project
You can find the files for our final project in the TicTacToe directory. The other directory, old_final_project was our initial idea, a roulette game. In the end this proved to be a bit to complicated to get the game working exactly how we wanted it. To play the game, we use MAMP which allows us to play the game on two seperate devices on the same internet network.
